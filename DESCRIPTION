Description: This package provides a streamlined workflow for the quanTIseq method,
    developed to perform the quantification of the Tumor Immune contexture from 
    RNA-seq data. The quantification is performed against the TIL10 signature
    (dissecting the contributions of ten immune cell types), carefully crafted 
    from a collection of human RNA-seq samples. The TIL10 signature has been 
    extensively validated using simulated, flow cytometry, and 
    immunohistochemistry data.
